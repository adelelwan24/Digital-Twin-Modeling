# Model 1: Stable Dream Fusion

The model uses the Zero 1-to-3 framework to generate 3d models based on a single RGB image input. The pre-trained model works by using a large diffusion model that is able to leverage zero-shot 3D shape reconstructions, this could be performed through

# Model 2: InstantMesh

It is a feed-forward framework for instant 3D mesh generation from a single image, featuring state-of-the-art generation quality and significant training scalability. By synergizing the strengths of an off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion model and a sparse- view reconstruction model based on the LRM architecture.

Instant3D proposes a diagram that predicts 3D shapes via an enhanced LRM with multi-view input generated by diffusion models. The method merges the LRMs with image generation models, which significantly improves the generalization ability. LRM-based methods use tri-planes as the 3D representation, where novel views are synthesized using an MLP, multilayer perceptron .

# Model 3: TripoSR

TripoSR leverages the transformer architecture and is specifically designed for single- image 3D

reconstruction. It takes a single RGB image as input and outputs a 3D representation of the object in the image. The core of TripoSR includes components: an image encoder, an image-to-triplane decoder, and a triplane-based neural radiance field (NeRF). The image encoder is initialized with a pre-trained vision transformer model, DINOv1, which projects an RGB image into a set of latent vectors. These vectors encode the global and local features of the image and include the necessary information to reconstruct the 3D object.

The subsequent image-to-triplane decoder transforms the latent vectors onto the triplane-NeRF representation. The triplane-NeRF representation is a compact and expressive 3D representation, well-suited for representing objects with complex shapes and textures.
